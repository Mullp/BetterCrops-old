# BetterCrops

A simple and lightweight plugin that adds small features to farming, but still sticks to the vanilla style.


## Features
* Right-click crops to quickly harvest and plant again. Works on;
  * _Wheat_
  * _Carrots_
  * _Potatoes_
  * _Beetroots_
  * _Nether wart_
* Having Feather Falling on your boots decreases the chance of trampling crops by jumping on them, ex;
  * _Feather Falling I = 25%_
  * _Feather Falling II = 50%_
  * _Feather Falling III = 75%_
  * _Feather Falling IV = 100%_

## Dependencies
None, just drag and drop, it's that easy ;)
