# BetterCrops

A simple and lightweight plugin that adds small features to farming, but still sticks to the vanilla style.


## Features
* Right-click crops to quickly harvest and plant again. Works on;
  * Wheat
  * Carrots
  * Potatoes
  * Beetroots
  * Nether wart
* Having Feather Falling on your boots decreases the chance of trampling crops by jumping on them, ex;
  * Feather Falling I = 25%
  * Feather Falling II = 50%
  * Feather Falling III = 75%
  * Feather Falling IV = 100%

## Dependencies
None, just drag and drop, it's that easy ;)
